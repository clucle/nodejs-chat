    dbpath=C:\data\db

    ##The path to the log file to which mongod should write its log messages.
    logpath=C:\mongodb\log\mongo.log

    ##I set this to true so that the log is not overwritten upon restart of mongod.
    logappend = true

    ##log read and write operations
    diaglog=3

    ##It ensures write durability and data consistency much as any journaling scheme would be expected to do.
    ##Only set this to false if you donâ€™t really care about your data (or more so, the loss of it).
    journal = true
